2018-05-03:
- Contains spectra of electrons, pi0, pi0primary, eta, omega, prompt/shower/direct/decay photons
- Cross-sections are always given in picobarn
- Used Pythia8.230 monash tune 2013
- NB: in order to get to high pt, the Minimum Bias process has been used only up to a certain momentum transfer pTHat. Above this threshold, HardQCD (= 'JetJet') and PromptPhoton (= 'GammaJet') processes have been used.
- There is a version that only uses JJ, but no GJ and no MinBias for low pt
