// define correlations between triggers/systems:
// either in % of respective error, or specifiy directly the size of uncorrelated error

// example: ClusterMinEnergy, 100% of ClusterMinEnergy Error is uncorrelated in PCMEMC with respect to PCM
PCMEMC PCM ClusterMinEnergy 100%

// example: Material, 50% of Material Error is uncorrelated in PCM with respect to PCMEMC. For each pT bin, the material error is multiplied with 50% and considered as uncorrelated (in general, error may vary with pT so that absolute sizes of uncorrelated errors per pT bin vary
PCM PCMEMC Material 50%

// example: ClusterNonLinearity, 2% ClusterNonLinearity Error is uncorrelated in PCMEMC with respect to EMC. For each pT bin, the uncorrelated error is taken to be constant at 2%
